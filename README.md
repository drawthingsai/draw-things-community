# Draw Things Community

This is a community repository that maintains public-facing code that runs [Draw Things the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/draw-things-ai-generation/id6444050820).

Currently, it contains the source code for our re-implementation of image generation models, samplers, data models within the app, and scripting engine. Over time, as we move more core functionalities into separate libraries, this repository will grow.

# Contributions

While we expect the development to be mainly carried out by us, we welcome contributions from the community. We do leverage Contributor License Agreement to make this more manageable. If you don't like to sign the CLA, you are welcome to fork this repository.

# Roadmap and Repository Sync

Draw Things the app is managed through a private mono-repository. We do nightly per-commit sync with the community repository in both ways. Thus, internal implemented features would be "leaked" to the community repository from time to time and it is expected.

That has been said, we don't plan to publish roadmap for both internal mono-repository and public community repository.
